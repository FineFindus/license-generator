### Overview

This is a blazing fast âš¡, command line license generator for your open source projects written in Rust.

I know that GitHub has a great GUI to add licenses to projects but I always found myself doing too much work. First you have to go to GitHub, create a file, type 'LICENSE', pick a license, push it and then pull it locally. With this you can just generate the license locally and push it to GitHub.

I had not written some Rust code in a while so I made this simple project to brush up my Rust skills a bit (still very beginner).
